## My process

I started with building the card container. Immediately, I was done with it,I proceeded tp create the second card which contains the contents using CSS Grid. I aligned the image to the center and then proceeded to align both of the paragraph to the center also.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

One of the problem that, I always had with CSS is how to add a box shadow to card and I am delighted that with the help of this project, I was able to overcome it.

```css
.btn {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  width: 250px;
  height: 370px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  display: grid;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

Having completed this project, one of the areas that I would love to work on is CSS Grid. I have not been able to master it properly and I still need to build more project with it.

Also, I'd like to focus more on how to create "CARDS" in CSS

### Useful resources
